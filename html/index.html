<h1><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/paperdb">Paper Database</a></h1>
<p>Hi, this is the rather basic home page of the paper and proceedings
database, paperdb.</p>

<p>Paperdb is a project I've created to maintain the conference papers
and conference proceedings information for the group I'm involved in. It
is written in PHP4 using a MySQL Database to hold the data, and has been
working really well so far.</p>

<p>I am a long way from being an expert PHP programmer, and indeed the
code is very simply done, so if you can help make paperdb better, do
let me know!</p>

<p>I've just released the first version to be split from the web pages,
which I've called 0.5 in recognition of the earlier work I've put in.
I have also been converting the scripts to use PHP without register
globals enabled, which has been fun!</p>

<p>The main content is the set of PHP files, and a guide follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>index.php - the "home" page.</li>
<li>config.php - database configuration code - edit me!</li>
<li>search.php, list_*.php - web user access routines</li>
<li>*_output_fns.php - routines that help create web pages</li>
<li>db_fns.php, paper_fns.php, admin_fns.php, user_auth_fns.php - routines
 that interact closely with the database </li>
<li>add_file.php, edit_paper.php, insert_*.php - code that the admin user
 can use to edit the database (mot all complete)</li>
<li>send_file.php - code to send a paper as inline content.</li>
<li>admin.php, form_output_fns.php - admin user pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the tarball you will find a few non PHP files. These are:</p>
<ul><li>bib2sql - a perl tool I used to populate the database. It
reads a BibTeX formatted file and spits out the required database
updates (very quickly: a couple of hundred papers a second!). To make
it work, you will need the Perl BibTeX code from CPAN.</li>
<li>bibcheck - a simple checking tool that uses the perl BibTeX code
to check the incoming .bib file for errors.</li>
<li>cpa2002.bib - an example paper from my site showing what a .bib
file looks like.</li>
<li>create_db.sql - the SQL script I used to create the database
structure (using "mysql &lt;create_db.sql"). It Deletes The Old Database!!</li>
<li>create_db_alt.sql - the result of calling "mysqldump --no-data" on
my test database. Does not have the "create database dbname" stuff in it, so you
will have to do a "create database dbname;" first. The script should
create the same database as create_db.sql, but looking at it I couldn't
be sure :-(</li>
<li>ReleaseNotes - the release notes for this release.</li>
<li>COPYING - the GPL License file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
