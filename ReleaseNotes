PaperDB 0.9 Release notes
=========================

A php/mysql application that implements a conference proceedings and papers
database, and the tools to view and update it. Currently used on the
www.wotug.org website to enable access to the papers presented at conferences.

The design of the database is such that papers can be linked to more than
one proceeding, and people and organizations are also recorded separately.
There is still work to do in supporting full access to organization records,
though.

Currently running on Fedora Linux/MySQL 3.23, PHP4 and Apache 2.0, but has
also worked with Apache 1.3 on Linux. Not tried on Windows/Apache/PHP/MySQL
but probably not lots of work to make it run there.

The code is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 2. See the
file COPYING for more information.

This release ...

Paperdb-0.8
===========

This release provides several bugfixes to the previous (0.7) release and
adds in several new features:

    + Editing proceedings is now possible online.
       
    + The BibTeX and Refer facilities are now more correct in terms of character
      coding at least, and it is possible to request a text/plain version of
      both refer and bibtex versions of both paper and proceeding bibliographies.
    
    + It is now possible to delete a file from a paper using the admin interface.
      and it is also possible to remove a paper from a proceeding.

    + Add support for storing MS Powerpoint and MS Word files in the file list,
      and made PDF the form's default format.

    + Admin navigation has been enhanced in two ways:
      
      - person name edit links are now referenced using a hyperlinked caret; this
        means that (albeit using unusual html) other code that uses href'd names
        can still be accessed.

      - Many of the pages now have additional links and the formatting of such
        links has become more standardized.


Significant bugs fixed:

    + More Fixes to edit_paper code from v0.7, should be improved now.
    
    + The admin interface page doesn't prompt for login details after you've
      logged in correctly.

    + all strings passed into sql are passed through the escaping code, even
      for items that seemingly couldn't be a problem.

    + lots of changes to check parameters more carefully.

    + no longer tries to include edit name Hrefs in BibTex or Refer output.


Paperdb-0.75
===========

This release provides several bugfixes to the previous (0.7) release and
adds in several new things:

    + Editing papers is now possible online!
       
    + Links to the proceedings associated with a paper are now included on the
       paper details page and when listing papers associated with an author.

    + Several places now have improved admin facilities, e.g. you can edit papers.
       even from the short-paper listing.

Significant bugs fixed:

    + Incorrect field name in the author updating and deletion code.

    + Authorlist ordering is now applied consistently.

    + Clean up formatting around paper -details abstracts.

    + Don't display the paper title in the html page title; it's too long in many cases.

    + Better html quoting of data.
