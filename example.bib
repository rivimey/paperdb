  abstract =     "This paper discusses the semantics of the prialt construct in Handel-C. The
                 language is essentially a static subset of C,
                 augmented with a parallel construct and channel communication, as found
                 in CSP. All assignments and channel communication events take one clock
                 cycle, with all updates synchronised with the clock edge marking the cycle
                 end. The behaviour of prialt in Handel-C is similar in concept
                 to that of occam, and to the p-priority concept of Adrian Lawrence's CSPP.
                 However, we have to contend with both
                 input and output guards in Handel-C, unlike the situation in occam,
                 although prialts with conflicting priority requirements are not
                 legal in Handel-C. This makes our problem simpler than the more general
                 case including such conflicts considered by Lawrence. We start with an
                 informal discussion of the issues that arise when considering the semantics
                 of Handel-C's prialt construct. We define a resolution function
                 (R) that determines which requests in a collection of prialts become active.
                 We describe a few properties that we expect to hold for resolution, and
                 discuss the issue of compositionality."
