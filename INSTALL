Paperdb-0.8 Installation
========================

A php/mysql application that implements a conference proceedings and papers
database, and the tools to view and update it. Currently used on the
www.wotug.org website to enable access to the papers presented at conferences.

The code is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 2. See the file
COPYING for more information.

The code consists of a number of php files, which must be be installed into a
suitable directory on the web server as required by your website. The files must
be under DocumentRoot.

There is a config file, config.php, in the source directory that you should:

  a) update to define the server names, page layout and so on.

  b) copy or move to /etc/paperdb , as this is where it is read from

The "home page" file is index.php. However, there is nothing particularly
special about this and on the 'native' website for paperdb I have created some
code on the site homepage to read a random article.


Initialising the database
=========================

Required Software
-----------------
Paperdb requires a MySQL database and support within PHP to access it.
This means that you will require the following PHP and MySQL components:

	httpd			# the webserver - apache in my case.

	mysql			# mysql clients and client libs
	mysql-server		# mysql server
        php
	php-mysql		# mysql support for php

        [ optional ]
	perl-DBD-MySQL		# perl DBD layer support for MySQL
	perl-Text-BiBTeX	# perl BibTeX interface 0.34

The following are the versions that work successfully together on my system
(Fedora Core Linux):

	httpd-2.0.50
	mysql-3.23.58
	mysql-server-3.23.58
        php-4.3.8
        php-mysql-4.3.8
        perl-5.8.3
	perl-DBD-MySQL-2.9002
        perl-Text-BibTeX 0.34

You need the perl and perl-DBD support only if you are going to populate the
database from BibTeX files.


Installing the files
--------------------

Unpack the files into the appropriate web server directory; for example, create
a directory paperdb in the root of your document tree and place the php files
into it. You do not require the html directory or the INSTALL, ReleaseNotes or
ChangeLog files; these can be deleted or moved elsewhere.

A copy of the file config.php must be placed in /etc/paperdb/config.php and
edited to match your site configuration. If you must place the config file
elsewhere you must edit the files html_output_fns.php and db_fns.php. Note that
by default the local config.php is not used.


MySQL/PaperDB Configuration
---------------------------

Configure MySQL in the usual ways, making sure you create an account suitable
for use by the webserver as well as an account you will use to administer the
system. The webserver account needs select, insert, delete, create, and update
privileges.

With your admin account log in to mysql using your favourite tool (for example
mysql, TOra or MySQL-Front). Create the database that paperdb will use:

> create database exampledb;
> use exampledb;

You can of course use a suitable name instead of 'exampledb'.

Run the SQL script create_db.sql from the source. This creates the database
schema (the set of tables the system uses).

> source create_db.sql

Insert into the admin table a paperdb admin account and password:

> insert into admin set username='user', password=password("mypassword");

There is no php interface to this for security reasons.


Inserting Data into the Database
================================

You might like to verify that the webserver sees the paperdb code now, but it
will be bery unexciting as there is nothing to look at. During the code's
development, the existing information was available as BibTeX files, so a perl
script was created to import the files into paperdb.


Using bib2sql
-------------

The major advantage of this is that mistakes can be rectified by deleting the
SQL database and starting again! The disadvantage is that it is a bit prone to
making mistakes with badly-formed bibtex input. You will probably have to tweak
the database unless you have very 'pure' bibtex files.

The BibTeX files must be well-formed, as the Perl Text::BibTeX are fairly
particular about the values they see. For the files I had, this meant ensuring
that the paper author line was of the form:

 author = "name1 and name2 and name3 and name4"

[where "nameN" could be a multiword string like "Dr John Jones"].

The perl script tries to use person, proceeding etc records that exist, but only
does this where the name it sees is the same. I didn't manage to get it to
realize that Dr J. Jones was the same person as Dr John Jones, so in the end I
just edited the source .bib file to make records look the same where I actually
knew they were.


Using the Web Interface
-----------------------

It is possible to enter proceedings and papers using the web interface. This
works reasonably well now, although it's still in it's infancy. Note that before
you can enter a paper, you must enter the proceedings it's in; before you can
enter paper or proceedings you must have authors and editors in the people list.
So the procedure is basically:

 1. Enter admin mode (invoke admin.php and enter the login/password pair). Your
browser will probably need to have cookie support enabled.

 2. Use "Add New Person" to add at least some of the people you'll be dealing
with. To begin with, at least the editors of the proceeding and the authors of
the first paper you'll add.

 3. Use "Add a new organisation" to create an organisation record for the
proceeding publishers.

 3. Use "Add a new proceeding" to create a proceeding record. This will take
place in two stages, with a second form that summarizes the first and requests
editor order as required.

 4. Use "Add a paper to a proceeding" to create your first paper record. This
will take place in two stages, with a second form that summarizes the first and
requests author order as required.
